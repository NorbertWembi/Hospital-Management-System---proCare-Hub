# Hospital Management System

## Overview

The **Hospital Management System** is a Java-based web application designed to streamline hospital operations and provide secure, real-time access to medical information. Built using **Java Servlets**, **HTML**, and **Apache Tomcat**, the system enables efficient management of patients, doctors, appointments, and billing while ensuring compliance with core information security principles.

The application aligns with the **CIA Triad**—**Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**—allowing authorized users, including patients, to securely access their medical records anytime and anywhere.
